## Features

### Taking Personal Information

### Showing the Information as a Record
Once the personal information is inputted, the system can display it as a record. This allows for easy viewing and management of student information.

### Deleting the Record
If a record is no longer needed, this feature allows the user to delete it from the system. This helps keep the database clean and relevant.

### Resetting Fields
In case of any errors or changes, the user can reset the fields of a particular record. This allows for easy editing and updating of information.
